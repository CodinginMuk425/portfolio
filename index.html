        <p>Welcome to my webpage! This is my first ever graded project for our Epicodus course. Below I will be including information about myself, the course, and why I am taking this course.</p>
        <div class="container">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>If you didn't know already, my name is Ramy (<em>Raw-me</em>). I am very to the world of coding, but I've always had a keen interest in the subject. While I am not working or studying, you can find me at the gym, spending time with friends & family, or playing video games with my cat on my lap. When the weather permits it, I embrace the outdoors. <span class="highlight">Some of things <strong>I love</strong> include the following (<em>in order</em>)</span>:</p> 
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Playing football</li>
                <li>Hiking trails</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>
            </ol></div>
        <h2>My Work/Education</h2>
        <p>After high school, I attended Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. During my time at PLU, I recieved my Bachelors in Communications and a Master's degree of Science in Marketing Reasearch. I am now a full time employee at a marketing company based in Seattle Washington. For my job I work as a vendor for Microsoft and am currently changing roles at work. My original postiion was focused on support Microsoft sellers in the field and ensuring they had the licenses needed to push for a sale. While my new role is now more focused on Event Planning and internal communications between teams, I have also had a major interest in the world of coding. There are opportunities at my company to provide some support with coding. This is why I have enrolled in Epicodus.</p>
        <h2>My Coding</h2>
        <p>In my previous section, I provided a bit of a background on my work and education. As described, I had never really had any major experiences with coding until recently. During my years of college, like many other, I considered myself an illiterate for coding. I felt helpless and simply dumb when I had to deal with any technology. As my career began and I've gained more experiences, I realized I need to conquer my fear and take the time to understand the what coding is and how it works. In our course so far, we've covered HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub/GitHub Pages, Bootstrap, & or course how to use it all in VS Code. Some of my work can be found below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://codinginmuk425.github.io/my-first-webpage/">my-first-webpage</a></li>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/CodinginMuk425/Japan_trip_blog">Japan Japan_trip_blog</a></li>
            <li> <a href="https://codinginmuk425.github.io/corgi-wolf/">Testing Pages</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of the project listed above are a small sample of what I have worked on thus far. The project "my first webpage" focused on building out a test site that focused on me. In it, I had applied multiple lessons into one by using CSS and HTML tags/elements. It was also one of the first projects we had an opportunity to use links in our site.<br> 
        The "Japan Trip Blog" was our first assignment for class. This was my first time using the Markdown language. I found this extremely beneficial given I may be using this language for a project at work.<br>
        Finally, I linked in my "Testing Pages" files. This was simply used for an assignment and educating me on the fundementals of classes and id tags. While the project is unfinished, I plan to use this for more future testing/practice scenarios.</p>
