        <h2 class="titles">About Me</h2>
        <p>If you didn't know already, my name is Ramy (Raw-me). I very to the world of coding, but I've always had a keen interest in the subject. While I am not working or studying, you can find me at the gym, spending time with friends & family, or playing video games with my cat on my lap. When the weather permits it, I embrace the outdoors. I love hiking, swimming, and have a major obsession with football. On this site, I will be covering the following:

        <h2>My Work/Education</h2>
        <p>After high school, I attended Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. During my time at PLU, I recieved my Bachelors in Communications and a Master's degree of Science in Marketing Reasearch. I am now a full time employee at a marketing company based in Seattle Washington. For my job I work as a vendor for Microsoft and am currently changing roles at work. My original postiion was focused on support Microsoft sellers in the field and ensuring they had the licenses needed to push for a sale. While my new role is now more focused on Event Planning and internal communications between teams, I have also had a major interest in the world of coding. There are opportunities at my company to provide some support with coding. This is why I have enrolled in Epicodus.</p>
