        <p>If you didn't know already, my name is Ramy (Raw-me). I very to the world of coding, but I've always had a keen interest in the subject. While I am not working or studying, you can find me at the gym, spending time with friends & family, or playing video games with my cat on my lap. When the weather permits it, I embrace the outdoors. I love hiking, swimming, and have a major obsession with football. On this site, I will be covering the following:
